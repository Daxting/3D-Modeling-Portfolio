# Project Overview: Innovative Machine Design

## Conceptualization and Development

Following data collection, team discussions, and analysis, we developed the conceptual design sketches for our project, incorporating a forklift and a mechanical arm.

Both machines were meticulously designed using Onshape software for 3D modeling. The main structures were then realized through 3D printing, utilizing resources provided by the school for manufacturing and processing. Through iterative testing and ongoing refinement after addressing various challenges, we ultimately achieved the completion of the machines.
