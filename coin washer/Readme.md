# The Imperative of Epidemic Prevention – The Genesis of the Coin-Washing Machine Concept

In the throes of the global pandemic, epidemic prevention has assumed paramount importance on the world stage. Despite the rise of societal habits like regular handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, mounting concerns persist in the public consciousness. In response, we conceived the idea of "washing coins."

During our typical school days, the noon break would see us heading to the local shopping street to procure lunch. Although everyone adhered to mask-wearing, suspicions arose among students and parents regarding potential oversights leading to epidemic vulnerabilities. Media reports, including those from [CommonWealth Magazine](https://www.gvm.com.tw/article/72131), often underscored the virus's ability to survive on the copper surface ofcoins for up to four hours. This compelled us to confront this significant issue.

## Casting a Stone to Draw Jade – Transforming Convenience into Action

The term "washing coins" may sound literal, but with the sheer quantity of coins involved, manual cleaning proved cumbersome and challenging. Hence, the concept of a "coin-washing machine" was born. Leveraging the machinery's mechanisms, we automated the coin-washing process, not only saving considerable time and effort but also aiming to raise epidemic awareness on campus and instill preventive habits in students from a young age.
